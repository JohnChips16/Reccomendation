## Description
This project is a Flask-based REST API that allows users to compare their profiles (including descriptions and skills) against a dataset of people profiles. It uses machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF for text processing, SVD for dimensionality reduction, and Nearest Neighbors for profile matching. The API returns the most similar profiles based on cosine similarity.
